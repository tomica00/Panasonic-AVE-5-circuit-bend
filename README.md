# Panasonic-AVE-5-circuit-bend
A more comprehensive documentation of various circuit bends on Panasonic AVE-5 video mixer.

##How it started
When I was a kid in the 1990s, I got fascinated by TV and as we had a camera at home, I started making my own TV shows and various experiments with in-camera VFX, but I craved a video mixer, to be able to do some keying and cool wipes and stuff. In 2023, an idea popped into my head to try to find one of these old video mixer. I looked on a local "Craigslist" type of website and there it was, Panasonic AVE-5. I immediately ordered it. It was in perfect condition. Then I searched for some documentation and found out that it can be circuit bent to do all sorts of cool glitches. This was the Karl Klomp mod, and I also found Tarcisio Drusin's contribution to this mod. Now, unfortunately, Karl Klomp's website is broken and I couldn't find the original mod, so I decided to do my own experiments. I saw Tarcisio used some memory pins, but there was a lot of pins they didn't use, so I decided to poke around with a multimeter set to measure milliamps, to short these pins to ground or short them together, to see what happens. I quickly found out that there are way more pins to circuit bend than I thought, so I decided to take an old IDE ribbon cable, solder 20 wires to pins that reacted to my poking, and make a nice breakout cable outside of the mixer.
